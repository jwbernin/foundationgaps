In Foundation, Hari Seldon is reported as being born in 11,988 GE, death 12,069.  -79 to 1 FE.

In Second Foundation, the Foundation vessel _Fearless_ is reported as being destroyed in the opening salvo of the 
Stettinian War in 11,692 GE, or 376 FE. We ignore the obviously incorrect GE date and use 376 FE, which translates 
to 12,444 GE. 

In Foundation's Edge, we are told that the Galactic Empire stood 12,000 years, and further that for 8,000 years prior
to this Trantor was the capital world of "a large and mighty political entity that spanned an ever-growing union of
planetary systems". (pg 77) 

In Pebble In The Sky, Bel Arvadan at one point refers to Josef Schwartz's native tounge (which we know to be 1950's 
American English) as being the same as that found in 50,000 year-old rock strata on Arcturus. This is improbable. In
Robots and Empire, Mandamus sets the W-particle accelerators to render the Earth uninhabitable in 15 decades, or 150 
years. Yet the Earth is still inhabited during this novel, though it is mostly a radioactive wasteland. I have 
arbitrarily decided that Mandamus' math was off by a double decimal shift, giving rougly 1500 decades, 15,000 years, 
from the time of Robots and Empire to the time when Earth becomes uninhabitable. This allows for the 8,000 years of
the Trantorian Empire prior to the founding of the Galactic Empire plus 6,000 years of prior human exploration and 
settlement of the galaxy. It is during this 6,000 year exploration phase that I place the other two Empire novels,
The Stars, Like Dust and The Currents of Space. There is still some uncertainty around how long after PITS the Earth
remained inhabited; I have (again arbitrarily) decided that the final human population was moved off Earth and onto
New Earth in the Alpha Centauri system (first encountered in Foundation and Earth) in just less than 1,000 years
after the events of PITS.
