Filling in the gaps in Asimov's future history

# Backstory
I've been a fan of Isaac Asimov's _Foundation_ series ever since I was in grade school. I've re-read the entire series
at least three times. I've always wanted to read more from this universe - more about Daneel, more about the Foundation,
more about the First Galactic Empire, just more of everything.

When Asimov passed, I was... more than unhappy, but I kept that to myself. I felt like a bit of Creation had been
overtaken by Chaos far too early, before it could truly flourish.

I started my most recent re-read of the entire series (starting with _The Caves of Steel_) about a month ago, and decided
tonight (July 3 2023) to embark on a project that had been floating around in the back of my head for years. I was going
to try to fill in the gaps in future history as best I could. 

This effort is purely personal, is not authorized by the Asimov estate or by any publisher or author, and although based
on canon, should not be considered canon itself. You're free to add to it, share it, or simply enjoy it (assuming you do
enjoy it). 

I will be using ASCIIDOC to write this, if you would like to contribute, I ask that you do so in ASCIIDOC as well. I
have not as yet defined any style conventions, I'm simply using my own style. If this repository gains enough interest
that a style guide is needed, I will create one at that point.
